## Due Thursday 4/8:
1. Have one person create a new repo for the group.
2. Add a `readme.md` to the repository that describes what social problem is being addressed, the local community or non-profit that is being empowered by your application, and what problems and solutions you think may arise in developing this application (both technical and ethical). 
3. Fill out the group project submission form here: [https://forms.gle/ioPHYzDXoNjEhKYi7](https://forms.gle/ioPHYzDXoNjEhKYi7)

Extra Credit: Reach out to a non-profit organization that your crowd-sourced mapping application could help support and incorporate them into the write-up.
