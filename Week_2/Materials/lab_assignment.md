# Lab Assignment #2 due 4/15
## Your Map Portfolio 
Create a home page for the individual maps that you will be making this quarter. Describe some of your interests and include a map with some markers. Think about the story you want to tell as a critical cartographer, feel free to include anything beyond the following requirements:

- Use the `<h1>` tag for your title
- Add at least 2-3 markers to the map with a common theme. For example: Organizations you've volunteered for or places you've traveled.
- Use the `<h2>` or `<h3>` tag to create a title for your map. 
- Add a `<p>` tag for a paragraph describing yourself and your goals as a critical map maker.
- Style some CSS by changing the background color, font, or anything else.
- Use an ordered list `<ol>` tag or an unordered list `<ul>` tag to list things.
- Include an `<img>` tag with a photo of yourself or an avatar. You can add other images as well to give some flavor to your page, like food or desserts.
- Use the `<a>` tag to add a link to 2 other web pages.
- Set up GitHub pages for your repo

 ### Submission: 
 In the `week_02` folder, just add a `readme.md` that links to your GitHub pages, the URL should look something like this:

  - https://albertkun.github.io/21S-ASIAAM-191A-Assignments/Week_02/index.html
